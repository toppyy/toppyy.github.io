    <h2>Setting up the environment</h2>
    <p>So you've decided to get into mainframes and are puzzled on where and how to start. I am also puzzled which is why made these notes.</p>
    What you'll need
    <ul>    
        <li>A mainframe emulator. I'll be using the <a href="http://www.hercules-390.org/">Hercules</a> emulator</li>
        <li>An operating system, here it'll be <a href="https://www.prince-webdesign.nl/tk5">MVS Tk5</a></li>
        <li>A terminal emulator for interacting with the mainframe emulator. I'll be using <a href="https://x3270.bgp.nu">x3270</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/toppyy/mvs-tk5-hercules">Here'll</a> you'll find a containerized version of MVS Tk5 running on Hercules. If you have a linux-machine, but no docker, you can just follow the commands in the dockerfile.
    If you're on windows/mac OS and do not have a docker installation, you're on your own.</p>

    <p>For getting started with MVS Tk5, read something like <a href="https://bradricorigg.medium.com/run-your-own-mainframe-using-hercules-mainframe-emulator-and-mvs-3-8j-tk4-55fa7c982553">this</a>. I won't be going through the UI so the rest you'll have to google/figure out.</p>

    <p>If you see this after running `docker compose up` and logging in, you're good to go.</p>
