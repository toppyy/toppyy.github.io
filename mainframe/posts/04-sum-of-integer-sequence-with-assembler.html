    <h2>Sum of a sequence of integers with Assembler</h2>
    <p>
        Below is an assembler program that counts the sum of first 10 integers (and the needed JCL to assemble and load it).

    <p>
        The program is rather straightforward. Use R2 to store the number to which to count to (10 in this example), R3 as the loop counter and
        R4 to hold the sum of integers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then loop until registers 2 and 3 are equal. If they are not, increment R3 by INCR (1 in this example) and add the value of R3 to R4 to keep tabs on the sum 
        of integers.
    </p>

        What's problematic is that we have no way of knowing the sum. Printing the sum is non-trivial compared to higher level languages that typically have print/console.log/whatever 
        to print values to console.
