            Here's a brief explanation of the ACID-acronym in case you've forgotten.

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Atomicity.</strong> Ensures that all operations within a transaction are completed successfully. If any operation fails, the entire transaction is aborted, and the database remains unchanged.</li>
            <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Guarantees that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another, maintaining all predefined rules, including constraints and triggers.</li>
            <li><strong>Isolation:</strong> Ensures that transactions are executed in isolation from one another. The intermediate state of a transaction is not visible to other transactions until it is committed.</li>
            <li><strong>Durability:</strong> Guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so, even in the event of a system failure. Changes made by the transaction are permanently recorded in the database.</li>
        </ul>
